## Overview

**IronVeil** is a cutting-edge, kernel-level anti-cheat framework designed to detect and prevent cheating in multiplayer games. By operating at the kernel level, IronVeil can provide robust protection against both user-mode and kernel-mode cheats, offering game developers a powerful tool to maintain game integrity.

## Features

- 🛡️ **Kernel-Mode Protection**  
  Hooks and monitors critical system functions to detect cheat activity below the user-space level.

- 🔍 **Real-Time Detection**  
  Actively scans for known cheat signatures and suspicious behavior.

- 🧩 **Modular Design**  
  Easily extendable for game-specific implementations and rule sets.

- 📉 **Low Overhead**  
  Optimized for performance to minimize impact on legitimate users' gameplay experience.

## Architecture

IronVeil consists of the following components:

- **Kernel Driver**: Core protection logic, hooking, and system monitoring.
- **User-Mode Client** (optional): Interface for interacting with the driver and reporting events to game servers.
- **Communication Layer**: Secure IOCTL or shared memory mechanism for relaying data.
