## Overview

IronVeil is a powerful, modular anti-cheat system built to secure modern multiplayer games from cheating and unauthorized modifications. Operating entirely in user-mode, IronVeil avoids the risks and complexity of kernel-level drivers while maintaining a high level of detection reliability and performance.

Designed with extensibility in mind, IronVeil supports a wide range of anti-cheat strategies, from behavioral analysis and memory inspection to process integrity validation and environment monitoring. Whether you're building a competitive FPS or a casual online RPG, IronVeil provides an adaptable framework for enforcing fairness and protecting game integrity.

> Important: IronVeil is a proprietary product. Use in production or monetized environments without a valid commercial license may violate terms of service. Please contact the development team for commercial licensing inquiries.

## Key Features

### Secure User-Mode Monitoring

IronVeil is designed to operate entirely in user space. It performs robust analysis of running processes, memory contents, and injected code without the need for kernel hooks. This reduces the likelihood of system instability, driver signing issues, or OS compatibility limitations.

### Real-Time Behavioral Analysis

Using heuristic models, IronVeil monitors player and system behavior during gameplay. It looks for suspicious timing patterns, unnatural inputs, automation scripts, and external influence that signal cheating behavior such as aimbots, macros, or rapid-fire triggers.

### Signature-Based and Heuristic Scanning

IronVeil maintains a library of known cheat signatures—including memory patterns, injected DLLs, and tool fingerprints. It combines these static methods with dynamic behavior analysis, allowing it to detect both known and novel forms of cheating.

### Anti-Debug and Virtualization Detection

To deter reverse engineering, IronVeil includes optional modules that detect debuggers, emulators, virtual machines, and common cheat development tools. It can trigger silent alerts, enforce bans, or flag suspicious sessions depending on configured policies.

### Game Integration API

IronVeil exposes a lightweight API that developers can integrate directly into their game engine or client code. The API allows for events to be sent, client-side context to be analyzed, and cheat-related data to be synchronized with game logic or servers.

### Modular Plugin System

IronVeil is built with modularity at its core. Developers can implement their own detection modules, configuration policies, or reporting systems. This makes IronVeil adaptable to a wide variety of game genres, engines, and network infrastructures.

### Lightweight Resource Usage

Unlike heavyweight anti-cheat systems that introduce stutter, crashes, or performance degradation, IronVeil is optimized for efficiency. Its asynchronous scan routines and minimal memory footprint ensure it operates smoothly even on mid-range hardware.

### Encrypted Communication Layer

IronVeil features a secure communication pipeline between the game client and remote telemetry/logging servers. All detection events, logs, and system information are encrypted in transit using TLS or custom symmetric encryption depending on deployment.

## How It Works

IronVeil is structured around several key subsystems that operate in coordination to detect and report unauthorized activity:

1. **Process & Memory Scanner**  
   Scans the game process and system memory for suspicious code regions, injected DLLs, hidden handles, or unauthorized memory access.

2. **Input Analysis Module**  
   Monitors mouse and keyboard inputs, detects artificial precision, timing anomalies, and patterns typically associated with macros or aim-assist tools.

3. **Environment Monitor**  
   Checks for debuggers, virtualization software, and third-party overlays. Also monitors system uptime, clock drift, and signs of tampering.

4. **Integrity Validator**  
   Periodically validates the hash and binary layout of both the IronVeil client and game binary to ensure no tampering has occurred.

5. **Remote Telemetry Handler**  
   Sends detection events to a remote endpoint for live monitoring, correlation, and response. Supports integration with dashboards, Discord bots, or custom moderation tools.

6. **Policy Manager**  
   Allows developers to define thresholds, sensitivity, and response actions. For example, one can configure IronVeil to auto-ban on critical signatures or simply flag suspicious behavior for manual review.

## Deployment and Integration

IronVeil is packaged as a lightweight user-mode library (.dll or .lib), plus optional supporting tools:

- **Client Runtime**: A compiled IronVeil binary embedded or bundled with your game.
- **Game-side Hooks**: Integration points into your game’s startup and session loops to enable IronVeil monitoring and data reporting.
- **Optional UIs**: For debug builds, developers can toggle logging or view detection states via a minimal UI.

Integration takes just a few lines of code using the provided SDK. Sample bindings for C++, Unity (C#), and Unreal Engine (via plugin) are available to licensed partners.

## Licensing and Terms of Use

IronVeil is released under the MIT License for evaluation and personal development use. Commercial deployment in any production or revenue-generating game requires a separate commercial license.

License tiers include:

- **Indie Developer Tier**: For solo developers and teams with annual revenue under $100K.
- **Studio Tier**: For medium to large studios with dedicated support, private builds, and priority updates.
- **Enterprise Tier**: Includes source access, full audit trail, and compliance-level support.
